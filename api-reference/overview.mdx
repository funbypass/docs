## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```
https://api.funbypass.com
```

## Request Format

All requests use **JSON** bodies with `Content-Type: application/json`.

Authentication is done via the `clientKey` field in the request body — no headers or bearer tokens required.

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/createTask` | Submit a new CAPTCHA solving task |
| `GET` | `/getTaskResult/{taskId}` | Poll for a task's result |
| `POST` | `/getBalance` | Check your account balance |

## Response Format

All responses are JSON with a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "errorId": 0,
  "taskId": "uuid",
  "status": "created"
}
```

- `errorId: 0` means success
- `errorId: 1` means an error occurred — check `errorCode` and `errorDescription`

## HTTP Status Codes

| `200` | Success or completed task |

| `404` | Resource not found (key, task, template) |
| `429` | Rate limit or thread limit exceeded |
