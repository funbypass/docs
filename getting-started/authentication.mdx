## API Keys

FunBypass uses API keys for authentication. Your key is passed in the request body as the `clientKey` field — there are no headers or bearer tokens required.

### Key Types

| Prefix | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `FUN-` | Balance-based | Pay-per-solve at $0.75/1,000 solves. Balance is deducted per task. |
| `PKG-` | Package-based | Subscription packages with daily/hourly quotas or unlimited solves. |

### Getting Your API Key

1. Sign up at [app.funbypass.com](https://app.funbypass.com)
2. Navigate to **Dashboard → Settings**
3. Copy your API key

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secret. Do not expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Authentication Flow

Every API request requires your `clientKey` in the request body:

```json
{
  "clientKey": "FUN-your-api-key-here",
  "task": { ... }
}
```

The server validates your key against the database and checks:

1. **Key existence** — The key must be registered
2. **Account status** — Account must not be suspended
3. **Package validity** — For `PKG-` keys, the package must be active and not expired
4. **Balance/Quota** — Sufficient balance or remaining quota for the request

## Balance-Based Keys (`FUN-`)

- **Cost:** $0.75 per 1,000 solves ($0.00075 per solve)
- Balance is deducted when a task starts processing
- If the task fails, the balance is automatically refunded
- Check your balance via the [`POST /getBalance`](/api-reference/get-balance) endpoint

## Package-Based Keys (`PKG-`)

Packages come in several types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `unlimited` | No solve limit during the subscription period |
| `daily` | Fixed number of solves per day, resets daily |
| `hourly` | Fixed number of solves per hour, resets hourly |

Package status can be `active`, `paused`, or `expired`. Only active packages can create tasks.

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive one of these errors:

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `ERROR_KEY_DOES_NOT_EXIST` | API key not found |
| `ERROR_ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED` | Account has been suspended |
| `ERROR_PACKAGE_PAUSED` | Package is currently paused |
| `ERROR_PACKAGE_EXPIRED` | Package subscription has expired |
| `ERROR_ZERO_BALANCE` | Insufficient balance (balance-based keys) |
| `ERROR_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Daily or hourly quota exceeded (package keys) |
