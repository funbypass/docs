title: Rate Limits & Concurrency
description: "Understanding rate limits, thread limits, and quotas."

## Concurrency Limits

Each user has a maximum number of concurrent tasks (threads) they can run simultaneously. The limit depends on your plan or package.

If you exceed your thread limit, the API returns `ERROR_THREAD_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED`.

## Package Quotas

Package-based keys (`PKG-`) have quotas depending on the package type:

| Package Type | Quota |
|-------------|-------|
| `unlimited` | No limit during subscription |
| `daily` | Fixed solves per day (resets at midnight UTC) |
| `hourly` | Fixed solves per hour (resets each hour) |

Exceeding your quota returns `ERROR_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`.

## Balance Protection

For balance-based keys (`FUN-`):

- Each solve costs **$0.00075** ($0.75 per 1,000)
- Balance is deducted when the task starts
- Failed tasks are **automatically refunded**
- Use `POST /getBalance` to check your current balance

## Handling Rate Limit Errors

When you hit a rate limit, implement exponential backoff:

```python
import time
import requests

def create_task_with_retry(client_key, task, max_retries=5):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        resp = requests.post("https://api.funbypass.com/createTask", json={
            "clientKey": client_key,
            "task": task
        })
        data = resp.json()

        if data.get("errorCode") == "ERROR_THREAD_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED":
            wait = 2 ** attempt
            time.sleep(wait)
            continue

        return data

    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

## Service Availability

If the service is temporarily disabled, all task creation requests return `ERROR_SERVICE_UNAVALIABLE`. Monitor the [status page](https://app.funbypass.com/dashboard/status) for real-time availability.
