## Supported Type

FunBypass currently supports **Arkose Labs FunCaptcha** (`FunCaptchaTask`).

## Challenge Types

### Game Type 3 — Image Selection

Multiple-choice image selection challenges. The user is shown a prompt and must select the correct image from a grid.

- **Waves:** 1–5 per challenge
- **Layout:** Grid-based with multiple options
- **Example variants:** Various image classification tasks

### Game Type 4 — 3D Interactive

Interactive 3D challenges that require object manipulation.

- **Waves:** 1–5 per challenge
- **Difficulty levels:** Easy, Medium, Hard
- **Example variants:**
  - `3d_rollball_animalss` — Roll a ball to the correct animal
  - `orbit_match_game` — Match orbiting objects

### Silent Pass

Some sessions receive a **silent pass** — no challenge is required. The token is returned immediately with `sup=1` in the token string. This is the fastest resolution path and requires no image classification.

## How It Works

1. The API generates a session with the target site's public key
2. Arkose Labs decides whether to issue a challenge or a silent pass
3. If a challenge is issued, our AI classifies each image and submits answers
4. The solved token is returned to you

## Template Support

FunBypass maintains a database of **4,440+ Arkose templates** covering a wide range of target sites. Templates are matched by `websitePublicKey` and contain the configuration needed to generate valid sessions.

<Info>
  If you receive `ERROR_TEMPLATE_NOT_FOUND`, the target site's public key may not be in our database yet. Contact support to request it.
